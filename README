DESCRIPTION ----------

Data structures and search algortihms


DIRECTORIES ----------

-
BFS                     Breadth First Search algorithm used in directed or undirected graph.

-
BST                     Binary Search Tree algorithm.

-
DFS                     Depth First Search algorithm used in directed or undirected graph.

-
Linked_List             Doubly linked list structure. Sorts strings lexicographically.

-
Long_List               Doubly linked list structure using longs. Parse large integer inputs
                        and runs mathematical operations on them.

-
Matrix                  Builds matrices with linked lists. Runs aritmetic operations on the structs.
